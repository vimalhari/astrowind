## Role overview

You’ll work on backend services that power client projects end-to-end: clean APIs, reliable background processing, and well-structured data models. We’re a remote-first team, so clear communication and solid engineering habits matter as much as raw output.

## What you’ll work on

- Building and evolving REST APIs using Django REST Framework
- Designing data models, migrations, and query patterns for performance
- Asynchronous workflows (queues, scheduled jobs) and operational reliability
- Test coverage and CI-friendly development (unit + integration)

## How we work

- Remote-first with async communication and focused deep work
- PR-based workflow with code reviews
- Pragmatic documentation: decisions, APIs, and handover notes

## Interview process

1. Short intro call (experience + role fit)
2. Technical discussion (Django/DRF + architecture + debugging)
3. Small take-home or live exercise (scoped and time-boxed)
4. Final conversation (team/workflow + offer)
