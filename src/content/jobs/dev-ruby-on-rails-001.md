## Role overview

You’ll ship production features in Ruby on Rails for international clients. The focus is on clean architecture, reliable background processing, and well-tested changes that are easy to maintain.

## What you’ll work on

- Rails 6/7 application development (features, refactors, upgrades)
- REST APIs and integrations with third‑party services
- Background jobs and async workflows (e.g., Sidekiq)
- Performance work: query tuning, caching, and observability

## What success looks like

- You can take a feature from requirements to deployment with minimal supervision
- You write tests that prevent regressions and make future changes safer
- You communicate clearly in PRs and keep changes scoped and reviewable

## Interview process

1. Intro call (role fit + availability)
2. Rails technical discussion (architecture, debugging, and tradeoffs)
3. Small exercise (time-boxed) or a focused live pairing session
4. Final conversation (team/work style + offer)

## How to apply

Send your resume and a short note about a Rails project you’re proud of:

- The scale (users/traffic) and what you owned
- One reliability or performance problem you solved
- Links (GitHub, portfolio) if available
